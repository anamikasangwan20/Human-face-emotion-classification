# Human-face-emotion-classification
This project was a part of a homework problem for the graduate course *EE 599 Deep Learning* at USC </br> </br>
Description: This is a supervised classification problem. We are given data of images with their labels. Each image is cropped to display only the face of a person. There is a csv file with 2 columns: image name and emotion (1 of 7). The objective is to design a neural network that can detect the emotions from these images. </br>
